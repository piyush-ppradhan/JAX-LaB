    change support. The fluid is advanced by the wrapped Multiphase solver
    (pytrees of distribution functions, one per component) while a single
    shared temperature field is advanced by the finite difference solver.

    The temperature equation solved is (reference 1 in the module docstring):
    \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla T + \\frac{1}{\\rho c_v}(\\nabla \\cdot (K \\nabla T)

    and velocity, and S_T is a user defined source term (see source()).

    The temperature field is passed into the fluid solver every step, so the EOS of the fluid solver must be constructed with
    temperature_field_type="thermal"; the pressure (and hence the pseudopotential) then follows the local temperature, which is what drives
    evaporation and condensation.
